A small study project on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Introduction
[Terraform]((https://www.terraform.io/)) is an infrastructure as code software by HashiCorp. It allows users to define 
a datacenter infrastructure in a high-level configuration language, from which it can create an execution plan to build 
the infrastructure such as OpenStack or in a service provider such as IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix), AWS, 
Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform. Infrastructure is defined in a HCL Terraform syntax or JSON format.

Terraform has excellent [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) and IntelliJ supports the HCL
syntax by means of a plugin.
