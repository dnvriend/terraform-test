# 05_standard_module_structure
The Terraform [standard module structure](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/create.html#standard-module-structure)
is a file and folder layout we recommend for reusable modules. Terraform tooling is built to understand the standard 
module structure and use that structure to generate documentation, index modules for the registry, and more.
