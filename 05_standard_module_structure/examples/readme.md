# examples
The examples folder contains examples on how to deploy multiple architectures. Examples contain a `readme`, `shell scripts` but also
terraform templates and so on required to deploy the architectures.

It is valuable to deliver a visual of the architecture that will be deployed by using eg. 
[cloudcraft](https://cloudcraft.co/app) or [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).  

## Description
You can add multiple versions of the solution you wish to deploy. For example, you can deploy the 'defacto' version with all bells an whistles,
but you could also create multiple smaller versions, each having its own name.
